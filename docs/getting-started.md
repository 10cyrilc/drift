# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and running DRIFT.

## Installation

You can download the latest version of DRIFT from the [releases page](https://github.com/10cyrilc/drift/releases).

## Running DRIFT

Once you have downloaded and extracted the appropriate binary for your system, you can run DRIFT using the `serve` command:

```bash
drift serve
```

By default, the server will run on port 8080. You can specify a different port using the `-p` flag:

```bash
drift serve -p 8081
```
